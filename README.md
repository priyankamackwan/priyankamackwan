<p><strong>Project Life Cycle I Follow: </strong></p>
<ol>
<li>I do requirement gathering and analysis first because this will be an important part of any project.</li>
<li>I discuss with clients their ideas and needs. Based on that I suggest going with a ready-made solution or to build our own which gives future flexibility. I also provide suggestions based on my experience and client need.</li>
<li>After the initial discussion, I work on cost estimation and a tentative timeline for the project. If the budget and timeline work for the client then we are good to move ahead.</li>
<li>First I do a kick-off meeting and give an overview of the project flow. I will also prepare a tentative deliverable with a set of features.</li>
<li>Then I do weekly meetings with clients by call and also give updates on a daily basis by email. I use our server while in development. So clients can review it and share their feedback.</li>
<li>Once I complete development I do web deployment and mobile app submission to respective stores. I also help clients in selecting a hosting provider. I also take responsibility to configure necessary software installation on the server if the server is dedicated.</li>
</ol>
